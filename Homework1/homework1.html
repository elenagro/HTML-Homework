        <!-- Introduction to cryptocurrency -->
        <p>A <strong>cryptocurrency</strong>, <strong>crypto-currency</strong>, or <strong>crypto</strong> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_currency" target="_blank">digital currency</a> designed to work as a medium of exchange through a computer network that is not reliant on any central authority, such as a government or bank, to uphold or maintain it.[2] It is a decentralized system for verifying that the parties to a transaction have the money they claim to have, eliminating the need for traditional intermediaries, such as banks, when funds are being transferred between two entities.[3]</p>
        <p>Individual coin ownership records are stored in a digital <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ledger" target="_blank">ledger</a>, which is a computerized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database" target="_blank">database</a> using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_cryptography" target="_blank">strong cryptography</a> to secure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce" target="_blank">transaction</a> records, to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership.[4][5][6] Despite their name, cryptocurrencies are not considered to be currencies in the traditional sense and while varying treatments have been applied to them, including classification as commodities, securities, as well as currencies, cryptocurrencies are generally viewed as a distinct asset class in practice.[7][8][9] Some crypto schemes use validators to maintain the cryptocurrency. In a proof-of-stake model, owners put up their tokens as collateral. In return, they get authority over the token in proportion to the amount they stake. Generally, these token stakers get additional ownership in the token over time via network fees, newly minted tokens or other such reward mechanisms.[10]</p>
        <p>Cryptocurrency does not exist in physical form (like paper money) and is typically not issued by a central authority. Cryptocurrencies typically use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization" target="_blank">decentralized control</a> as opposed to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank_digital_currency" target="_blank">central bank digital currency</a> (CBDC).[11] When a cryptocurrency is minted or created prior to issuance or issued by a single issuer, it is generally considered centralized. When implemented with decentralized control, each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, typically a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain" target="_blank">blockchain</a>, that serves as a public financial transaction database.[12] Traditional asset classes like currencies, commodities, and stocks, as well as macroeconomic factors, have modest exposures to cryptocurrency returns.[13]</p>
        <p>The first decentralized cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, which first released as open-source software in 2009. As of March 2022 there were more than 9,000 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cryptocurrencies" target="_blank">other cryptocurrencies</a> in the marketplace, of which more than 70 had a market capitalization exceeding $1 billion.[14]</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <hr />
        <p><i>See also: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_bitcoin" target="_blank">History of bitcoin</a></i></p>
        <p>In 1983, American cryptographer David Chaum conceived of a type of cryptographic electronic money called ecash.[15][16] Later, in 1995, he implemented it through Digicash,[17] an early form of cryptographic electronic payments. Digicash required user software in order to withdraw notes from a bank and designate specific encrypted keys before it can be sent to a recipient. This allowed the digital currency to be untraceable by a third party.</p>
        <p>In 1996, the National Security Agency published a paper entitled <i>How to Make a Mint: the Cryptography of Anonymous Electronic Cash</i>, describing a cryptocurrency system. The paper was first published in an MIT mailing list[18] and later in 1997 in <i>The American Law Review</i>.[19]</p>

        <!-- Definition -->
        <h2>Formal definition</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>According to Jan Lansky, a cryptocurrency is a system that meets six conditions:[33]</p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>The system does not require a central authority; its state is maintained through distributed consensus.</p></li>
            <li><p>The system keeps an overview of cryptocurrency units and their ownership.</p></li>
            <li><p>The system defines whether new cryptocurrency units can be created. If new cryptocurrency units can be created, the system defines the circumstances of their origin and how to determine the ownership of these new units.</p></li>
            <li><p>Ownership of cryptocurrency units can be proved exclusively cryptographically.</p></li>
            <li><p>The system allows transactions to be performed in which ownership of the cryptographic units is changed. A transaction statement can only be issued by an entity proving the current ownership of these units.</p></li>
            <li><p>If two different instructions for changing the ownership of the same cryptographic units are simultaneously entered, the system performs at most one of them.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>In March 2018, the word cryptocurrency was added to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webster%27s_Dictionary" target="_blank">Merriam-Webster Dictionary</a>.[34]</p>

        <!-- Architecture -->
        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>Cryptocurrency is produced by an entire cryptocurrency system collectively, at a rate which is defined when the system is created and which is publicly stated. In centralized banking and economic systems such as the US <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve" target="_blank">Federal Reserve System</a>, corporate boards or governments control the supply of currency.[citation needed] In the case of cryptocurrency, companies or governments cannot produce new units, and have not so far provided backing for other firms, banks or corporate entities which hold asset value measured in it. The underlying technical system upon which cryptocurrencies are based was created by Satoshi Nakamoto.[53]</p>

        <!-- Economics -->
        <h2>Economics</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>Cryptocurrencies are used primarily outside banking and governmental institutions and are exchanged over the Internet.</p>

        <!-- Social trends -->

        <p>According to Alan Feuer of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times" target="_blank">The New York Times</a>, libertarians and anarcho-capitalists were attracted to the philosophical idea behind Bitcoin. Early Bitcoin supporter Roger Ver said: "At first, almost everyone who got involved did so for philosophical reasons. We saw Bitcoin as a great idea, as a way to separate money from the state."[105] Economist Paul Krugman argues that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are "something of a cult" based in "paranoid fantasies" of government power.[106]</p>

        <!-- Increasing regulation -->
        <h2>Increasing regulation</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>The rise in the popularity of cryptocurrencies and their adoption by financial institutions has led some governments to assess whether regulation is needed to protect users. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has defined cryptocurrency-related services as "virtual asset service providers" (VASPs) and recommended that they be regulated with the same money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) requirements as financial institutions.[115]</p>

The criticisms include the lack of stability in their price, the high energy consumption, high and variable transactions costs, the poor security and fraud at cryptocurrency exchanges, vulnerability to debasement (from forking), and the influence of miners.[191][192][193]</p>
